# App Template

A simple starter project to form the basis of any goodboy project

When creating a new repo on GitHub you can use this repo as a template. This will clone all the files and branches for you.
You can use these to start a project and then follow typical workflows e.g. feature->develop->master.

Please remember to change the name of the project in the package.json
